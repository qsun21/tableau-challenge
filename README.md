I used two CSV files, one for January 2020 and one for June 2020.  I wanted to compare a summer month with a winter month to see if there are any unexpected phenomena.


1.  For the "day of the week" dashboard, I wanted to find out if weekend days are when most people rent bikes in NYC.  It turned out that that was completely wrong.  In January the highest number of people rented bikes on Thursday, with Sunday being much less than Thursday.  In June the highest number of people rented bikes on Tuesday, also unexpected.  Weekend days in June were again significantly lower than Tuesday.

2.  I wanted to see differences between January and June in average trip duration per station.  An interesting observation is that the relative gradient representing average trip duration is the same between January and June.  This means that from a given station people tend to take the same length trips in June as they do in January.  One unexpected phenomenon was that there was a small region in June of very long trips located in the Northeast corner of the map.  That region was completely missing in January with no trips at all in any of those stations.

3.  I set up top 10 stations buy ride count in June and January.
The distribution of those top 10 stations in June was completely different from the distribution of the top 10 stations in January.  In June they were scattered along the perimeter of Manhattan whereas in January they were clustered in the center of Manhattan.
